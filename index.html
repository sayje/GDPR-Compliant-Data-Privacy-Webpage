            <h2>Data Privacy: RA 10173</h2>
            <p>The Philippines Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012, and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), aim to protect individuals' personal information in both government and private sector systems.  The law aims to protect personal data security while promoting transparency and trust in digital systems, ensuring privacy without jeopardizing the free flow of information necessary for innovation and growth.  The National Privacy Commission (NPC) is designated as the primary regulatory authority in charge of ensuring the Act's implementation and compliance (Republic Act No. 10173 Philippines, n.d.).
            <br>
            The Data Privacy Act applies to all types of personal data, whether recorded in paper or electronic form, and covers both automated and manual processing systems.  It establishes the rights of data subjects, including the right to be informed, the right to access, the right to object, and the right to erasure or blocking of personal data.  Organizations are required to implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  They must also appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and handling data privacy-related matters within the organization (Republic Act No. 10173 Philippines, n.d.).
